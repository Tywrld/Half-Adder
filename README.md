# Half-Adder

In this read me, ill be discussing* how an half adder works along with diagrams and pictures of a working half-adder ive made in colage*. I'll also be discussing* binary and binary adding and how to perform math equations* with it.


# What is Binary?

  Binary is a numbering system that only uses "1" and "0". we can call this on and of, or true and false. We call binary the base 2 system because we use 2 digits to repensent any qauntity.
We use binary in computers to compute numbers and values because its the simplest method for counting numbers. Computers can use binary to manipulate and store data.

# How to count in Binary?

  Counting in binary is a fairly simple task, remember* the system is base 2 so, numbers such as 2,3,4,5, ect.. does not exist; its only 1's and 0's. With that being said heres how you do it!
To do binary to binary adding all you have to do is carry when you reach a number higher than 1; for example 101 + 001 is 110. 1 + 1 is 2 so we carry the one to the next place. 111 + 111 is 1110 we get this number because we are carrying to the next but, you notice that when we carry to the next digit we get 3, to handle this instead of putting a 0 and carrying the 1, we put a 1 and carry a 1.

Sum of 2:

# How to read Binary?

  Humans, believe it of not use the base 10 system. that means we count up to 9 until we have to carry. we learned how to count like this all our lifes so its very easy for us to understand. Binary on the other  hand use the base 2 system so its a little different, remember we have to carry after 1 so that means that 001 + 001 = 010 this in the base 10 system is 2. To convert binary to decimal we have to keep on increasing the power of 2 as long as number of digits in binary number increases.

# what is an adder?

  A adder circuit is a digital electronic circuit designed to perform the mathematical operation of addition, essentially adding two binary numbers together. This is how computers make calculations, There are 2 types of adders "half-adder" and "full-adder" , in this document we'll only be going over the half-adder.
